","body":"\r\n  As a local organizer, it would be wonderful to be more tied in to the direction of the larger Node.js community. There are many user groups that have expressed a need for help with resources, speakers, and guidance. Knode was started right after CascadiaJS after a number of Node organizers at the conference were talking about their struggles with local groups and how they'd love a sharing mechanism. By creating a portal that allows for user groups to help support each other, we will grow the community we hold dear.\r\n\r\n_The More You Know_ ¸.·´¯`★\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease [file issues](https://github.com/knode/knode.github.io/issues) for what you'd love to see from Knode! \r\nContributing documentation and roadmap coming SOON.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
